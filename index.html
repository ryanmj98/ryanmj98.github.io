            The North Ridge Country Club Womens Tennis is an inclusive group that loves to
            spend their free time on the courts with other women who share the same love for
            tennis as them. New members are frequently joining so there is always a team
            for new women to join. The outdoor season at NRCC is most active in April and
            May. Although, many of the women play year round at different places around Raleigh
            in leagues, but NRCC remains the hub for the majority of the play.

            Every team has clinic every week. This makes sure that the women are able to keep
            their technique sharp with the help of the NRCC professional staff to help advise 
            on different form and play strategies. One clinic per team means that if a lady is on 
            two teams they play twice that week and have clinic twice too. Although, not 
            everyone playes every week. There are more women on a team than are able to play every
            week. This makes it so that if one lady is unable to go then they still have enough and
            do not have to forefiet a court.

            Finally, there are playoffs. These are extremely competitive and not all of the teams
            make them. The different levels of teams that are offered at NRCC are 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and
            4.0. This means everyone has people around their skill level they are able to play with.
